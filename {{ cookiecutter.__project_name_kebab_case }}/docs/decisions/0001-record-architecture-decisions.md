# 1. Record architecture decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.
When new team members join, they need to understand the reasoning behind past decisions.

## Decision Outcome

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard
in [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs are stored in `docs/decisions/` and follow the template in `adr_template.md`.

### Consequences

- Decisions are documented and easily discoverable.
- New team members can read the decision log to understand the project's history.
- Each ADR is small and focused on a single decision.
